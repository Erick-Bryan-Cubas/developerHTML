# Create a Web Page Using Learned Tags

## Understanding the Challenge
 
The idea of this Project Challenge is to create a website, using a very basic structure, using tags learned during practical classes: 
Use all tags explained in classes: 
```html
<h1> to <h6>, <p>, <mark>, <small>, <i>, <u>, <strong>, <ol>, <ul>, <li >, <a>, <hr>, <sub>, <sup>, <blockquote>;
```

Use new suggested tags:
```html
<font>, <del>, <p>, <abbr>
```
(the idea is to look for these tags on the internet, understand how they work and use them in the text).

All source code developed during the course was versioned on GitHub, at the following address: https://github.com/digitalinnovationone/trilha-html-modulo-1
